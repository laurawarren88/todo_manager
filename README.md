# **A command line TO-DO LIST in Javascript**

## ⭐️ Overview

This is a javascript functioning To-do List.

Tasks are added, saved and removed from the command line.

All tasks can be saved 🛟 to either a csv or tsv file depending on need (comment out the one you don't need)

In order to understand the functionality use 'node todo.js help'.

This will display the commands to use and a helpful 🆘 key for description type and colour.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

This project assumes you have the following:

```text
🔸 Have a basic understanding of Javascript to make changes if needed.
🔸 Access to a command line
🔸 Use VS code as your IDE (If not skip step three and use your own IDE)
🔸 Have the latest version of nodeJS installed
```

## 🐾 Step One

In order to use this To-do list on the command line. Firstly, change your directory to where you wish to run this script and store 🏪 the cloned repository:

```bash
cd <filename>
```

## 🐾 Step Two

Clone the repository from github and then move into the new directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/laurawarren88/todo_manager.git
cd todo_manager
```

## 🐾 Step Three

Take a look 👀 around the file 📂 structure and see what is happening.

```bash
code .
```

You can make the necessary changes to use either a csv or tsv file if you wish 🌠.

You could also add more categories to types of activities if you wish, this to-do manager only has the following types: Personal 🏠, Work 👷🏻‍♀️, Health 🧘🏼‍♀️ and Urgent ❗️.

## 🐾 Step Five

In order to make sure you have the right functionality before running the script you will need to upload the necessary packages used in this script.

To do this run 🏃🏼‍♀️:

```bash
npm init
```

## 🐾 Step Six

Now you have the packages 📦 initiated you can run the script and will have the right functionality.

I suggest to start this script with:

```bash
node todo.js help
```

This will display 🖥 a list of commands for the To-do list on your terminal.

## 🐾 Step Seven
