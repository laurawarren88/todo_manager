# **A command line To-do List in JavaScript**

## ⭐️ Overview

This is a JavaScript functioning To-do List.

Tasks are added, saved and removed from the command line.

All tasks can be saved 🛟 to either a .csv or .tsv file depending on need (comment out the one you don't need)

To understand the functionality use 'node todo.js help'.

This will display the commands and a helpful 🆘 key for description type and colour.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

This project assumes you have the following:

```text
🔸 Have a basic understanding of JavaScript to make changes if needed.
🔸 Access to a command line
🔸 Use VS code as your IDE (If not skip step three and use your IDE)
🔸 Have the latest version of NodeJS installed
```

## 🐾 Step One

To use this To-do list on the command line. Firstly, change your directory to where you wish to run this script and store 🏪 the cloned repository:

```bash
cd <filename>
```

## 🐾 Step Two

Clone the repository from GitHub and then move into the new directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/laurawarren88/todo_manager.git
cd todo_manager
```

## 🐾 Step Three

Look 👀 around the file 📂 structure and see what is happening.

```bash
code .
```

You can make the necessary changes to use either a .csv or .tsv file if you wish 🌠.

You could also add more categories to types of activities if you wish, this to-do manager only has the following types: Personal 🏠, Work 👷🏻‍♀️, Health 🧘🏼‍♀️ and Urgent ❗️.

## 🐾 Step Five

To make sure you have the right functionality before running the script you will need to upload the necessary packages used in this script.

To do this run 🏃🏼‍♀️:

```bash
npm init
```

## 🐾 Step Six

Now you have the packages 📦 initiated you can run the script and will have the right functionality.

I suggest to starting this script with:

```bash
